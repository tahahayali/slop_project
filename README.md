# slop_project
This is a project for my resume, I will attempt to make a social media website, with the specialty that we will crack down on bots and any AI generated content

# Use of AI
Lowkey hypocritical, but for this project, I will use AI as a tool only to learn concepts when I need to. My assurance for this project is that 100% of text, code, or anything else is human made. 

# Goal
The overarching goal for this project is to make an intentionally vulnerable app, learn about the vulnerabilities, exploit them, then patch them. This will be a good reference for my resume and be a good teacher in the realm of AppSec

A smaller goal for this project is that I'll be able to make and start up a (hopefully) functional social media platform

I'll demonstrate common web app vulnerabilities that I saw on OWASP's top 10 list for 2025. I went through the list and picked out a few ones specifically, I'll go over them in the scope

# Learning goals
I hope to learn common app sec tasks that engineers go through regularly, and explore both the technical (code) and professional (documentation) sides of the security field

# Scope
The vulnerabilities I picked are as follows:

1. Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
2. Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
3. CSRF
4. Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
5. Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator
6. Unprotected storage of credentials
7. Improper privilege management
8. Unrestricted upload of files with dangerous types
9. IDOR attack
